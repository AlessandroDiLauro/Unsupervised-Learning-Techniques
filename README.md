# Unsupervised Learning Techniques
 
<h2>Clustering for dataset exploration</h1>

<p>Unsupervised learning can be a powerful tool for exploring and understanding your data. Clustering algorithms can help you identify patterns and relationships within your data that may not be immediately apparent. In this repository, you'll find examples of how to use clustering to discover insights in your data.</p>

<h2>Visualization with hierarchical clustering and t-SNE</h2>

<p>Effective visualization is an important aspect of exploring and understanding your data. In this repository, you'll find examples of how to use hierarchical clustering and t-SNE to visualize high-dimensional datasets in a 2D space. This can be particularly helpful when working with large datasets that are difficult to visualize directly.</p>

<h2>Decorrelating your data and dimension reduction with PCA</h2>

<p>PCA is a powerful technique for decorrelating your data and reducing the dimensionality of your dataset. In this repository, you'll find examples of how to use PCA for dimension reduction and visualization of high-dimensional datasets.</p>

<h2>Discovering interpretable features with NMF</h2>

<p>Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a technique for discovering interpretable features in your data. In this repository, you'll find examples of how to use NMF to extract meaningful features from your dataset and understand the relationships within your data.</p>
